Check Guidebook for my favorite places to eat and hang out. BEACH-GOERS: If the focus of your visit is to be close to the ocean, there are better accommodation options on the Westside, such as Santa Monica or Venice. With heavy traffic and a rather smaller network of Metro lines, staying near the neighborhoods you will be spending most of your time visiting is a smart idea. If you are just planning to visit for a day or two, good planning could save you time, and I am ha

Yes	The beautiful Mount Olympus - where Hollywood royalty lay their hats. Located in the magnificent Hollywood hills and 20 minutes from most LA sights, the neighborhood is a quiet oasis in the most interesting and exciting part of Los Angeles. The hills are perfect for hikes, a 5 minute drive will get you to the hottest bars and clubs in the city, and thanks to the elevation, most days are sunny and warm, perfect for a dip in the pool!
No	The Neighbourhood is one of the coolest area's in town ! The area is full of pines and eucalyptus. Hawks soar the updrafts all day and great horned owls can be seen and heard at night. Sometimes you get lucky and see deer roaming around the property.  It's quaint and quiet up here in the hills but all the hustle and bustle is just a 10 minute drive down the road. We have a little Canyon Country store close by which is a flashback to the sixties when The Doors where living ...literally next door. You can quickly make a run down the hill with your car when you run out of wine.
No	Neighborhood is comprised mostly of professionals, actors and film industry types.
Yes	Our neighborhood is located in mid city which is perfect for exploring West LA's beaches, Downtown LA's attractions, and is a short drive or Uber ride away from Hollywood. It's called mid city because it's in the middle of the city - and therefore centrally located exactly in between the beaches and down town Los Angeles.

Yes	Manhattan Beach is very different than other beach cities in California. It offers a relaxing yet upscale feeling with plenty of activities. Manhattan Beach benefits from ocean breezes that provide clean air and summer temperatures that are cooler than inland areas of Southern California. Manhattan Beach is a hot spot for beach volleyball and surfing. Every summer, the city hosts a volleyball tournament, surf events, concerts in the park, and more.
Yes	East Hollywood is conveniently located between Hollywood, Los Feliz, Silver Lake, and Koreatown. Griffith Park is right up the street and you can even walk from our apartment to the Observatory if you have an hour. It's not a swanky neighborhood and some might even call it run-down, but it's also a more realistic view of how the average working-class person lives in L.A.  There are numerous restaurants nearby and an awesome gelato place, Scoops, right down the street. Our favorite cafe, The Red Dragon, is a five minute walk, and if you're a night owl, there are late night donuts and tacos within two blocks.  Our neighborhood is also called Little Armenia, so you can find lots of Armerian bakeries and markets. All of L.A. has great Latin American food, and our neighborhood is no different. We live on a noisy corner of our neighborhood and there are two major streets within two blocks of us, so you can often hear sirens and helicopters nearby. Minor downside to being so central, but some

No	We are fairly high up in the mountains giving you just enough space from the city, but still close enough to catch a movie and a bite in Old Town, a Saturday morning game at the Bowl or a night out in Downtown.

The amount of trails in the area is phenomenal and ranges from easy to difficult hikes that everyone can enjoy!

Melrose Ave and LaBrea Ave are also within walking distance, and both are lined with excellent restaurants, cafes and shopping.  Trader Joe‚Äôs is also about a 5 minute drive by car down LaBrea.

Yes	The house is calm and mostly quiet, although I live near the airport and off a Main Street,  especially since you'll be in the back house.  *Please Note: this is a blue collar, working class neighborhood in the South Bay. It's off a Main Street with a municipal airport nearby. It's an urban area with cars. It's minutes from LAX and super accessible to freeways. Not far from posh areas, however it is not Rodeo Drive. Just an informational tip.  The neighborhood is safe.  Access to a grocery store and necessities are easy. There is plenty to see nearby; parks the beach, shopping. The Laundromat I recommend is located at Broadway  Center, 12402 Inglewood Ave, Hawthorne, CA 90250. It is close, clean and convenient. I do charge after four guests, including children.  I do not charge for babies under (24 mos) two years old. Most importantly, I will work with you, but please do not misrepresent the number of guests on the reservation.

Yes	"If you are looking to stay at an actual L.A. Filming location used in a movie production, you have found it! This idyllic Southern California home was used as filming location for the 2011 comedy-drama movie ‚ÄúLarry Crowne.""  The neighborhood is an upscale residential community in the San Fernando Valley within the Los Angeles County and walking distance to California State University, Northridge, also known as CSUN. Situated on a very quiet dead-end street at the far end of a small cul-de-sac with the charm of Valley suburb is great area for morning runs or walks. The home seats on a big lot with plenty of open spaces for you to experience the outdoors. The backyard has a kidney shaped inground swimming pool (not heated) surrounded by palm trees, shrubs an orange grove and many fruit trees. When someone on the west side refers to ""over the hill""; they mean ""The Valley"". It is the northernmost region of the City of Los Angeles, separated from the LA Basin by the Hollywood Hills/Santa Mo"
Yes	Location Location location! The newly remodeled modern studio is just 1 minutes from everything you need including Hip & Trendy Abott Kinney,  Venice Canals, Main street, and of course 1 minute to THE BEACH !

And yet is just a 5- 7 minute enchanting bike ride to Marina Del Rey & Santa Monica.
Yes	Our home is located in South LA.  Our neighborhood is culturally and economically diverse - which is what we value about being here.   We are in between downtown and the coast, which is really nice for getting around. Great locally owned eats nearby.  Some of my favorite are: Tracey's Belizian, Post and Beam, Los Alcatraces, Moreton Fig, Kouraku Restaurant (downtown LA), Myungln Dumplings (K-Town), Chosun Galbee (K-Town), or any neighborhood street vendor.

Hollywood is very central and is populated by all socioeconomic classes, so it comes with its light and its shade, but my street is quiet and mostly populated by families. The Kodak Theater, Hollywood Walk Of Fame, Madame Tussaud's, the Hollywood Wax Museum, Paramount Pictures, Hollywood Forever, and Grauman's and the Chinese Theaters are all within walking distance. There's a CVS pharmacy a block away, and Trader Joe's and Pavillions are a short walk away for groceries (or else there are dozens of cafes and restaurants in the neighborhood if you, like me, prefer someone else to do the cooking). The freeways are easily accessible. It's close to the action, but being a couple of blocks away from the thick of things provides a great escape when you need to turn down the volume.
No	There are nearby restaurants, mostly towards Korea Town via a three minute drive. There are a few markets nearby, but soon there will also be a Target within walking distance. This is Hollywood and is a melting pot of people, but is also very safe. If you are interested in sight seeing, I would recommend renting a car. Every guest gets a personal parking space.
No	Friendly neighborhood.  Private School at the end of our street.  School cross-walk button across venice blvd for pedestrians.
No	This is a quiet suburban neighborhood off of Chandler Boulevard. We are a quick drive to the 101 and 405 freeway.

The calm water of the bay makes for family gatherings with swimming, kayaking, stand-up boarding, sailing and boating. 2nd Street, about 100 yards away, is home to great restaurants, upscale boutiques, spas and salons and great night life. Strollers, bikes and dog walking are a familiar scene as people enjoy this charming seaside community."
Yes	The hills of Monterey Park is a quiet neighborhood with families all around. Just down hill in downtown Monterey Park is every assortment of the best Chinese food in Los Angeles.

Yes	Down to earth side of the famous Hollywood. Whatever that means :)
No	We are a very quite neighborhood. There are 10 acres that surround us. And only 4 homes. Making this one of very few unique properties in San Dimas.

Yes	There is a 7/11 across the street, a Pier 1 on the same block. I'm right off of Hollywood Blvd and the 101 freeway. The Walk of Fame is just a few blocks.  My location is very close to Universal Studios/Universal City Walk. Venice and Santa Monica Beach are about 12-15 miles away so you could be there in 40 minutes or an hour and a half it all depends on traffic!
Yes	One of Santa Monica's nicest family neighborhoods, Sunset Park is full of single family homes, parks, and schools.  If you hope to enjoy Santa Monica like a local, this is a great place.  You can use the Santa Monica College swim center or run their track, stroll up Ocean Park Blvd. to find some good food at Thyme Cafe, Shaka Shack for a burger, have sandwiches made for you while you buy provisions at Bob's Grocery Store, or a tasty frozen yogurt at Treat's.  A bit further, Il Forno is an excellent Italian restaurant, Lare's an excellent Mexican one, Upper West a trendy American style bar and restaurant.  Stroll down the hill to Lincoln Blvd. to Gelson's grocery store (excellent deli and prepared foods) or my favorite restaurant, Rize (sushi and Thai, beautiful space, modern, great happy hours!) Neighborhood gems

Yes	A short walk from Abbot Kinney Blvd and Venice Beach, this home is near all of the action but in a quiet area where you can relax. You're less than 2 blocks from Abbot Kinney Blvd, a real hotspot for artists, and home to some of LA's best shops, restaurants and bars including several excellent art galleries, about a half-dozen interesting clothing boutiques and over a dozen cafes and eateries. You're also only half a mile to the famous Venice Beach!
Yes	Malibu, for us, is trails, hiking and riding! For others it is surfing, beaches, Road Biking and shopping! We are situated right in the middle of everything Malibu has to offer. No long winding drives. From Reel Kick Ranch, the beach is 1/2 mile drive or a 15 min walk to Latigo shores. World renown '1st point' Malibu pier beach is a ten minute drive and Zuma beach is a 15 min drive. We are between Solstice canyon and Escondido canyon parks and many others are only a short drive away! Latigo canyon road is also a famous motorcycle, road bike and driving canyon road. Be safe!

The apt community has heated saltwater pool, on-site saltwater swimming Gym, salted pool, fireplace, rooftop lounge, BBQ and dog park, public Wi-Fi; No need to mention walking distance to beach, piers, Abbot Kidney Blvd, and the trending Rose ave with great bars and restaurants.

Yes	Be sure to turn your tire when parking on the hilly street near our place.
Yes	This is literally in the heart of Hollywood. My building is quiet, safe and comfortable but the second you step outside you're greeted by all that Hollywood has to offer: the glamor, the fun and the weird. You can walk to Hollywood Blvd., Sunset Blvd. and the metro which can take you anywhere. GREAT SPOT!

No	I live in a condo complex of 156 units.  People are very friendly and we have a security guard at night which makes us doubly safe because Culver City is a safe place to be anyway.  The weather is great almost all the time! Culver City is a little gem in the middle of LA. The weather can't be beat. Very little smog. 10 minutes to the beach, 5 minutes to Sony Studios, 15 minutes to Fox. It's a short walk to the supermarket and some restaurants. The closest mall is about a mile away. We are part of Silicon Beach and next to West LA, Playa Vista, Playa Del Rey, Marina Del Rey, Venice, and Santa Monica. Our location is just ideal!
Yes	10 minutes away from Downtown LA.* 15 minutes away from Mid-City (where The Grove is located).* 20 minutes away from Westside.* (*By car, without traffic. Traffic is bad during rush hour so use Waze to get accurate arrival times.) There are many restaurants and bars short 10min walking distance, a 24-hour grocery store and The Wiltern Theatre.
No	Good neighborhood, ample parking for at least 4 cars, everything you may need is only minutes away.
No	Beautiful residential neighborhood, only a 2 minute walk from the beach.

No	Located in a quiet, residential neighborhood of houses with long time residents, you won't feel like a tourist.  The ice cream truck still drives through the streets when the weather's warm. There are no shared walls with neighbors, but the area is generally quiet, besides the occasional train crossing, so we ask you to be courteous and try to keep noise down in the early mornings and late evenings.  Neighbors look out for each other and will report any unusual activity back to me.  Exterior-only cameras and motion sensor outdoor lights discourage people from creeping around and would-be package thieves (which luckily hasn't happened so far.)

Yes	Downtown LA is booming right now with lots of great bars and restaurants! That said, this is an urban environment with all of the things that typically go along with that. There's a large homeless population centered nearby and the Metro station next to my building is a hub for commuters of all stripes. DTLA is a safe place but when walking throughout the neighborhood, travelers should exercise the same caution they would in any major city.

The city was founded in 1781, during the 1930s, it was deemed as a fashionable suburb known as the Westlake District.

Rather notorious in the 1980s as where you go to get a fake ID, the area is now mostly working class families. Remarkably ungentrified (in the best possible way), the neighborhood is safe and authentically LA. On weekends in the summer months, there are often amazing free concerts in the nearby park. These generally end by 9 or 10pm.

A metro train and bus stops, Chase Bank, small market, liquor store, laundromat, post office, clothing stores, restaurants, police station with 24 ATM inside, library, and pharmacies are all located within 5 minutes walking distance (1 to 3 blocks). Although families are out during the day, I always recommend people try to avoid walking around at night.
Yes	"I think the best part about this space is the location. It's close to everything! 5-15 minutes away from the most popular spots in Los Angeles (Glendale, Echo Park, Pasadena, Alhambra, Burbank, Downtown, etc). Also, this area has become one of the safer parts of Los Angeles over the past few years. The $1 billion LA River project is in full effect.  Many families live on this block, kids play on the street, and the neighbors are super friendly. There are bars and a fire station nearby and it does get pretty noisy around here during weekends. We do provide earplugs for our guests! We're currently renovating the exterior, starting with the roof/paint. The neighborhood is a bit old and isn't well-lit but we're doing our best to renovate. We've had a few ""Am I in the right place?"" moments from guests but they quickly (URL HIDDEN) what's on the inside that counts. :) In the interim, we just want to provide a fun, safe, and comfortable space for everyone.

Change to Blue Line at ""Willowbrook/Rosa Park Station""; 3. Catch the metro to 7th Street/Metro Center (It's the last station of the blue line); 4. Change to Red and Purple lines and catch a metro rail to ""Union Station"" (It's the last station of theses lines); 5. Catch a metro to Atlantic's Station (It's the last one); 6. Get off of the Metro Rail and cross the street. There's a bus stops in front of the Prep Boys. Wait to the Bus 260. This bus stops in the Atlantic and Repetto Street. Where our house is located.

No	Vogue, May 2017: A walk down Highland Park‚Äôs Figueroa Street on a sunny Sunday afternoon reveals the Northeast Los Angeles neighborhood‚Äôs glorious mix: Mid-century modern furnishings spill out the front doors of antique shops; elote vendors sit at curbs across from record stores, hair salons, and pour-over coffee shops; groups of friends linger over brunch cocktails. To see something of the neighborhood‚Äôs past and present, start at Highland Park Bowl, a vintage social space and bowling alley originally opened in 1927. Back in those Prohibition days, it housed a doctor‚Äôs office and pharmacy so revelers could, in classic California style, obtain booze for ‚Äúmedical reasons.‚Äù Later a music venue, and once more renovated and reopened last year, the retro-cool spot (where Emma Stone went bowling with Jason Gay during her Vogue cover interview) now boasts a restored Spanish Revival facade and a 1930s Arts and Crafts mural behind the lanes, plus twin horseshoe-shaped bars and a restaurant.

I really love this area and have been here for 2 years. Los Angeles isn't a city that has great public transport. If you want to be in a ""walkable"" dense city neighborhood, then I recommend looking in Downtown, Venice/Santa Monica, or Hollywood. I love Echo Park so much, but some guests who aren't from LA or don't know much about it seem to look for a denser city feel."

Yes	Hollywood Hills: Once upon a hillside, this area was a vast western frontier, where farmers grew crops and cowboys roamed the countryside. But in 1923 that all changed when one man premiered the giant letters that would alter the landscape of Southern California forever.
