And of course the spectacle and scenes of the Boardwalk.

Griffith Park is right up the street and you can even walk from our apartment to the Observatory if you have an hour. It's not a swanky neighborhood and some might even call it run-down, but it's also a more realistic view of how the average working-class person lives in L.A.  There are numerous restaurants nearby and an awesome gelato place, Scoops, right down the street. Our favorite cafe, The Red Dragon, is a five minute walk, and if you're a night owl, there are late night donuts and tacos within two blocks.  Our neighborhood is also called Little Armenia, so you can find lots of Armerian bakeries and markets. All of L.A. has great Latin American food, and our neighborhood is no different. We live on a noisy corner of our neighborhood and there are two major streets within two blocks of us, so you can often hear sirens and helicopters nearby. Minor downside to being so central, but some

Yes	"If you are looking to stay at an actual L.A. Filming location used in a movie production, you have found it! This idyllic Southern California home was used as filming location for the 2011 comedy-drama movie “Larry Crowne.""  The neighborhood is an upscale residential community in the San Fernando Valley within the Los Angeles County and walking distance to California State University, Northridge, also known as CSUN. Situated on a very quiet dead-end street at the far end of a small cul-de-sac with the charm of Valley suburb is great area for morning runs or walks. The home seats on a big lot with plenty of open spaces for you to experience the outdoors. The backyard has a kidney shaped inground swimming pool (not heated) surrounded by palm trees, shrubs an orange grove and many fruit trees. When someone on the west side refers to ""over the hill""; they mean ""The Valley"". It is the northernmost region of the City of Los Angeles, separated from the LA Basin by the Hollywood Hills/Santa Mo"
Yes	Location Location location! The newly remodeled modern studio is just 1 minutes from everything you need including Hip & Trendy Abott Kinney,  Venice Canals, Main street, and of course 1 minute to THE BEACH !

And yet is just a 5- 7 minute enchanting bike ride to Marina Del Rey & Santa Monica.
Yes	Our home is located in South LA.  Our neighborhood is culturally and economically diverse - which is what we value about being here.   We are in between downtown and the coast, which is really nice for getting around. Great locally owned eats nearby.

Yes	This is such a convenient spot to reside in. Hollywood is very central and is populated by all socioeconomic classes, so it comes with its light and its shade, but my street is quiet and mostly populated by families. The Kodak Theater, Hollywood Walk Of Fame, Madame Tussaud's, the Hollywood Wax Museum, Paramount Pictures, Hollywood Forever, and Grauman's and the Chinese Theaters are all within walking distance. There's a CVS pharmacy a block away, and Trader Joe's and Pavillions are a short walk away for groceries (or else there are dozens of cafes and restaurants in the neighborhood if you, like me, prefer someone else to do the cooking). The freeways are easily accessible. It's close to the action, but being a couple of blocks away from the thick of things provides a great escape when you need to turn down the volume.
No	There are nearby restaurants, mostly towards Korea Town via a three minute drive. There are a few markets nearby, but soon there will also be a Target within walking distance. This is Hollywood and is a melting pot of people, but is also very safe. If you are interested in sight seeing, I would recommend renting a car. Every guest gets a personal parking space.

The calm water of the bay makes for family gatherings with swimming, kayaking, stand-up boarding, sailing and boating. 2nd Street, about 100 yards away, is home to great restaurants, upscale boutiques, spas and salons and great night life. Strollers, bikes and dog walking are a familiar scene as people enjoy this charming seaside community."

Yes	Down to earth side of the famous Hollywood. Whatever that means :)
No	We are a very quite neighborhood. There are 10 acres that surround us. And only 4 homes. Making this one of very few unique properties in San Dimas.

Yes	One of Santa Monica's nicest family neighborhoods, Sunset Park is full of single family homes, parks, and schools.  If you hope to enjoy Santa Monica like a local, this is a great place.  You can use the Santa Monica College swim center or run their track, stroll up Ocean Park Blvd. to find some good food at Thyme Cafe, Shaka Shack for a burger, have sandwiches made for you while you buy provisions at Bob's Grocery Store, or a tasty frozen yogurt at Treat's.  A bit further, Il Forno is an excellent Italian restaurant, Lare's an excellent Mexican one, Upper West a trendy American style bar and restaurant.  Stroll down the hill to Lincoln Blvd. to Gelson's grocery store (excellent deli and prepared foods) or my favorite restaurant, Rize (sushi and Thai, beautiful space, modern, great happy hours!) Neighborhood gems

You're also only half a mile to the famous Venice Beach!

Yes	Laurel Canyon is famous for the musicians who have lived here. Wildlife abounds, so don't be surprised to see deer in the front yard or on the back hill. The house is secluded, yet minutes from the Sunset Strip, Beverly Hills, and Hollywood.
No	I live in a condo complex of 156 units.  People are very friendly and we have a security guard at night which makes us doubly safe because Culver City is a safe place to be anyway.

Very little smog. 10 minutes to the beach, 5 minutes to Sony Studios, 15 minutes to Fox. It's a short walk to the supermarket and some restaurants. The closest mall is about a mile away.

Also very close to El Porto, the local surf spot and only a short car ride or walk to the main street area of Manhattan Beach Blvd. LAX is also only a short cab ride away, so it's convenient for those flying in or out of LA.
No	Raw nature surrounds us. Listen to the symphony of birds in the morning. Hear the frogs and coyotes at night. Stargaze and moon-gaze without the glare of city lights. Do deep mindfulness breathing before sunrise and inhale the fresh air scented with wild plants. Sun-gaze and energize yourself at sunrise. Hike in the rustic trails or do walking meditation.

With a vastly diverse population and landscape, even micro climates, there will be pros and cons about each and every neighborhood - we share some common problems in the city such as homeless people and bad traffic. It is very safe and a family-friendly neighborhood, nevertheless.  There is a local bicycle shop and an awesome Mexican restaurant right across the street. Highland Park, Eagle Rock and Occidental College to the north, Downtown LA to the south & Dodger Stadium to the Southwest is just 10 minutes drive, so it is very centrally located in a car city.

Our home is a 5 minute drive east from the town proper, where you'll find a grocery store (Agua Dulce Farms) and a variety of restaurants. For a great family-style Mexican meal I'd recommend Maria Bonita's, and Sweetwater Cafe for great steaks, pasta, sandwiches or more.

Yes	Compton is a multi-cultural city with a lot of flavor.  We got a Mexican restaurant across the street that offers Coffee and Mexican bread for $1.25 everyday(but they are closed by 10pm).

Yes	In recent years, Silver Lake has become known as the ground zero for the young and hip.  While this may be true, it’s only part of the story.  Silver Lake is a vibrant and eclectic village with its own identity and personality.  It’s a mecca for young artistic types from all around the world, but families as well as longtime residents populate its charming hillside enclaves. The heart of Silver Lake is of course the lake, or in this case, the Silver Lake reservoir, which is the community’s focal point and a popular place for people to jog, bike, or walk. This sparkling body of water and the rolling hills surrounding it make for one of the most picturesque neighborhoods in all of L.A.

Yes	Downtown LA is booming right now with lots of great bars and restaurants! That said, this is an urban environment with all of the things that typically go along with that. There's a large homeless population centered nearby and the Metro station next to my building is a hub for commuters of all stripes. DTLA is a safe place but when walking throughout the neighborhood, travelers should exercise the same caution they would in any major city.
Yes	The neighborhood is unique because most of the buildings around the area are historical landmarks. The city was founded in 1781, during the 1930s, it was deemed as a fashionable suburb known as the Westlake District. Once home to primarily European and Mexican-American populations, this neighborhood is now home to immigrants from Central America, Mexico, Cuba, and Korea, who add new layers to the neighborhood's unique character. Although the residents have changed, it still looks much the same as it did more than a century ago. In 2004, the area became the city's nineteenth Historic Preservation Overlay Zone.

Walk a few blocks west and enjoy the vibrant food scene of Ktown or a block east and watch a game of neighborhood soccer. Rather notorious in the 1980s as where you go to get a fake ID, the area is now mostly working class families. Remarkably ungentrified (in the best possible way), the neighborhood is safe and authentically LA. On weekends in the summer months, there are often amazing free concerts in the nearby park. These generally end by 9 or 10pm.
No	I love that the neighborhood is quiet.  There are lots of great restaurant
No	This is a highly sought out Upscale neighborhood of Century City which is the center point between Beverly Hills and Westwood. Close to UCLA.

A metro train and bus stops, Chase Bank, small market, liquor store, laundromat, post office, clothing stores, restaurants, police station with 24 ATM inside, library, and pharmacies are all located within 5 minutes walking distance (1 to 3 blocks). Although families are out during the day, I always recommend people try to avoid walking around at night.
Yes	"I think the best part about this space is the location. It's close to everything! 5-15 minutes away from the most popular spots in Los Angeles (Glendale, Echo Park, Pasadena, Alhambra, Burbank, Downtown, etc). Also, this area has become one of the safer parts of Los Angeles over the past few years. The $1 billion LA River project is in full effect.  Many families live on this block, kids play on the street, and the neighbors are super friendly. There are bars and a fire station nearby and it does get pretty noisy around here during weekends. We do provide earplugs for our guests! We're currently renovating the exterior, starting with the roof/paint. The neighborhood is a bit old and isn't well-lit but we're doing our best to renovate. We've had a few ""Am I in the right place?"" moments from guests but they quickly (URL HIDDEN) what's on the inside that counts. :) In the interim, we just want to provide a fun, safe, and comfortable space for everyone.

Some of the best museums in LA are in walking distance: Broad, MOCA (museum of contemporary art). Visit the beautiful Walt Disney Concert Hall, even see the LA Philharmonic. Also recommend visiting the Grand Central Market, a Los Angeles institution. Directly across from Grand Central, make sure to visit the Bradbury Building (arguably the most architecturally significant building in downtown). Another favorite of mine is the Last Bookstore, (Hidden by Airbnb) it. And if you can go to see a basketball game at Staples Center, Clippers or Lakers. Or even a Hockey game, there's nothing quite like a Los Angeles Kings g

A suggestion for how to get here by Metro Rail, it's faster than just use a bus. For example: 1. Catch the green metro rail's line at the ""Aviation/LAX""; 2. Change to Blue Line at ""Willowbrook/Rosa Park Station""; 3. Catch the metro to 7th Street/Metro Center (It's the last station of the blue line); 4. Change to Red and Purple lines and catch a metro rail to ""Union Station"" (It's the last station of theses lines); 5. Catch a metro to Atlantic's Station (It's the last one); 6. Get off of the Metro Rail and cross the street. There's a bus stops in front of the Prep Boys. Wait to the Bus 260. This bus stops in the Atlantic and Repetto Street. Where our house is located.

No	Vogue, May 2017: A walk down Highland Park’s Figueroa Street on a sunny Sunday afternoon reveals the Northeast Los Angeles neighborhood’s glorious mix: Mid-century modern furnishings spill out the front doors of antique shops; elote vendors sit at curbs across from record stores, hair salons, and pour-over coffee shops; groups of friends linger over brunch cocktails. To see something of the neighborhood’s past and present, start at Highland Park Bowl, a vintage social space and bowling alley originally opened in 1927. Back in those Prohibition days, it housed a doctor’s office and pharmacy so revelers could, in classic California style, obtain booze for “medical reasons.” Later a music venue, and once more renovated and reopened last year, the retro-cool spot (where Emma Stone went bowling with Jason Gay during her Vogue cover interview) now boasts a restored Spanish Revival facade and a 1930s Arts and Crafts mural behind the lanes, plus twin horseshoe-shaped bars and a restaurant.

Yes	If New York City's Brooklyn neighborhoods were bathed in sunshine, they might find their west coast counterpart in Los Angeles' Highland Park. Not too far from Downtown, this northeast LA neighborhood is on the fast track to mass appeal.

Despite its analog attitude, Highland Park's evolution continues as it's propelled by another moving accouterment—the Metro Rail Gold Line easily connects commuters to the rest of the city.

From tourist attractions like the Walk of Fame’s collection of stars (numbering more than 2,614 and growing by one or two a month) to career opportunities like those presented in the expanding tech industry, Los Angeles is the place to be. It is the only city in North America to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice. Downtown L.A. is the largest government center outside of Washington, D.C.
