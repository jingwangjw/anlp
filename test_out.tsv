No_TAB_I am just on the border of downtown proper, which means that you're in walking distance of several great restaurants and bars to the south.  Going north of Anaheim St. can get a little rough.  I recommend going for walks alone up there during day light hours, however south of Anaheim is fine.  You'll find Pine Ave., the heart of downtown Long Beach runs one block east of my street.  The good stuff on Pine is between 8th and Ocean, along with lots of other good stuff on the Promenade, which runs west and parallel to Pine.  Not a street, but lots of fun places to eat and spend time.  My cross street is 12th and the streets are in numerical order starting with 1st a block up from the marina.  Two Mexican restaurants are within two blocks of my place and have great food.

Yes_TAB_North Hollywood's charms might at first seem hidden, or at least understated. But in its own endearing and refreshingly un-hip way, this neighborhood in the southeast corner of the San Fernando Valley has become one of L.A.'s best. Tucked between the slicker Studio City, solidly middle-class Burbank, mansion-filled Toluca Lake and the pleasant, leafy grid of Valley Village, the core of North Hollywood has a vibe all its own - a little more gritty and densely urban. It's easy to get anywhere from here: Folks anywhere near the main drag, Lankershim, can walk pretty quickly to the Red Line stations at Universal or Chandler and zip into Hollywood or downtown in a matter of minutes. For cars, NoHo is also a wonderland of nearby freeways - (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) . A trip to Sunset & Vine literally takes just eight minutes. There's good access to at least four city parks. On Magnolia, in the block between Lankershim and Vineland, you now find the Republic of Pie, the Bow & Truss tapa_NEWLINE_

Not to be outdone, the restaurants in Echo Park and Silver Lake are also pretty great.
